23.3.2.5 Chronic Groin Disruption (Sports Hernia)

Sports hernia refers to a condition of chronic groin pain caused by a weakness of the posterior inguinal wall *without* a clinically obvious hernia (TAYLOR et al. 1991). WESTIN 1997; RENSTROEM 1997 and RENSTROM 1992 believe that sports hernias may be the most common cause of chronic groin pain in athletes. By definition, none of the patients have evidence of a preoperative hernia, although some patients are found to have occult hernias at the time of surgery (FISHMAN and ZYBERT 1992). Because of the insidious onset and non-specific nature of the symptoms, there is often a prolonged course before diagnosis. In one study, the average duration of symptoms was 20 months, with a range of 6 weeks to 5 years (HACKNEY 1993).

Our findings in acute groin disruption suggest that sports hernia is only part of a spectrum of lesions described as groin disruption. The term groin disruption was first coined in 1980 when three professional soccer players with chronic, apparently career-ending groin pain, underwent surgical exploration and repair and were then able to return to competitive sport. The posterior wall abnormalities found in groin disruption are more varied than those associated with sports hernias. They may include tears of the external oblique aponeurosis, tears of the conjoined tendon or dehiscence of the conjoined and inguinal ligament, again without any evidence of a *true* hernia (MEYERS et al. 2000a,b; GILMORE 1998). Clinical complaints of loose feeling of the inguinal floor are common. There is also groin pain on exertion but uncommon with Valsalva's manoeuvre, coughing and sneezing.
